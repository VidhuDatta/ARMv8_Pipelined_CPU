# ARMv8_Pipelined_CPU

• Designed a 64-bit ARM7 CPU with 5-stage pipelining.
• Developed hazard detection using branch predictors and forwarding units, which optimized pipelining performance
 by effectively managing data, structural and control hazards.
• Benchmarks used for testing are also included.
